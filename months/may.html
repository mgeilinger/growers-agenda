        <p>Welcome to Growers Agenda! This platform was set up as a tool to help keep track of the monthly tasks, specific to what you've got growing in your garden.</p>
        <p>On the right, under the 'my garden' tab, you are able to input all the plants growing in your garden, creating a personalized profile for yourself. From there, you'll receive monthly reminders for pruning, fertilizing, and other essential maintenance tasks tailored to each plant's specific needs.</p>
        <p>Once all your flowers are updated, you may also use the 'flowering time' feature. This tool allows you to see what you can expect to see flowering in your garden at any given month of the year.</p>

            <h1>Gardening in May</h1>
            <p>May is the peak of spring growth, and frost risk fades in most areas. Plant out summer bedding, harden off seedlings, and keep on top of weeding and watering as temperatures rise.</p>

        <div class="text-box rosemary">
            <h1>Fertilise container-grown rosemary</h1>
            <p>After your rosemary finishes flowering, typically in late spring or early summer, it's the ideal time to give it a boost with a balanced fertiliser. Container-grown rosemary relies on you to replenish nutrients, as soil in pots can quickly become depleted.</p>
            <p>Choose a general-purpose balanced fertiliser, such as one with an NPK ratio close to 10-10-10. Apply it according to the package instructions, ensuring the soil is moist beforehand to prevent root burn. This feeding will help maintain healthy growth, encourage new foliage, and support the plant's resilience for the rest of the growing season.</p>
