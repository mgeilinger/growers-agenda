        <p>Welcome to Growers Agenda! This platform was set up as a tool to help keep track of the monthly tasks, specific to what you've got growing in your garden.</p>
        <p>On the right, under the 'my garden' tab, you are able to input all the plants growing in your garden, creating a personalized profile for yourself. From there, you'll receive monthly reminders for pruning, fertilizing, and other essential maintenance tasks tailored to each plant's specific needs.</p>
        <p>Once all your flowers are updated, you may also use the 'flowering time' feature. This tool allows you to see what you can expect to see flowering in your garden at any given month of the year.</p>

            <h1>Gardening in September</h1>
            <p>September brings cooler days and a shift toward autumn. Harvest apples and plums, plant spring-flowering bulbs, and tidy up garden beds for the coming months.</p>

        <div class="text-box lupin">
            <h1>Divide lupin</h1>
            <p>Dividing lupin in September is a great way to rejuvenate the plants and encourage more vigorous growth for the next season. As lupins can become crowded over time, dividing them helps prevent overcrowding and promotes better air circulation, reducing the risk of disease.</p>
            <p>Simply lift the plant, carefully separate the roots, and replant the divisions in well-drained soil. This gives the new plants time to establish their roots before the colder months, ensuring they bloom strongly the following year.</p>

            <h1>IDEA: Plant spring flowering bulbs</h1>
            <p>Late September is the perfect time to plant spring-flowering bulbs, such as daffodils, crocus and hyacinths. By planting these bulbs now, you give them time to establish roots before the colder months, ensuring vibrant blooms when spring arrives.</p>
            <p>Plant bulbs at the recommended depth, usually two to three times their height, with the pointed end facing upward. Water thoroughly after planting to help establish roots, and consider adding a layer of mulch to retain moisture and suppress weeds. These cheerful flowers will add early-season color to your garden, providing a welcome burst of brightness after winter. </p>
