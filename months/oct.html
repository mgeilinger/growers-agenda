        <p>Welcome to Growers Agenda! This platform was set up as a tool to help keep track of the monthly tasks, specific to what you've got growing in your garden.</p>
        <p>On the right, under the 'my garden' tab, you are able to input all the plants growing in your garden, creating a personalised profile for yourself. From there, you'll receive monthly reminders for pruning, fertilizing, and other essential maintenance tasks tailored to each plant's specific needs.</p>
        <p>Once all your flowers are updated, you may also use the 'flowering time' feature. This tool allows you to see what you can expect to see flowering in your garden at any given month of the year.</p>

            <h1>Gardening in October</h1>
            <p>Autumn colours dominate in October as the growing season winds down. Rake up fallen leaves, cut back perennials, and plant trees or shrubs in the cooling soil.</p>

        <div class="text-box rosemary">
            <h1>Prune rosemary</h1>
            <p>In autumn, typically around October, itâ€™s a good time to mulch rosemary to protect the plant from colder temperatures as winter approaches. Apply a light layer of mulch, such as bark chips or gravel, around the base of the plant to help insulate the roots. This will provide protection from frost and prevent the soil from freezing.</p>
            <p>Be careful not to over-mulch, as rosemary dislikes overly moist conditions. A thin layer is sufficient to offer protection while allowing for proper drainage.</p>
