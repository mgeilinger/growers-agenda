        <p>Welcome to Growers Agenda! This platform was set up as a tool to help keep track of the monthly tasks, specific to what you've got growing in your garden.</p>
        <p>On the right, under the 'my garden' tab, you are able to input all the plants growing in your garden, creating a personalised profile for yourself. From there, you'll receive monthly reminders for pruning, fertilizing, and other essential maintenance tasks tailored to each plant's specific needs.</p>
        <p>Once all your flowers are updated, you may also use the 'flowering time' feature. This tool allows you to see what you can expect to see flowering in your garden at any given month of the year.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="top-bar" id="topBar">
        <div id="timeline-info">
            <h1>Flowering Time</h1>
            <p>The timeline provides a clear visual representation of the months in which your plants will be flowering. This tool was designed to help you identify periods where nothing is in bloom, allowing you to consider introducing new plants to fill these gaps and ensure a continuous display of flowers throughout the year.</p>

            <h1>Gardening in January</h1>
            <p>A quiet month for the garden, January is ideal for planning the year ahead. Clear away the debris and ensure your tools are sharp and ready for spring.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-box rhubarb">
            <h1>Start forcing rhubarb</h1>
            <p>January is the perfect time to begin forcing rhubarb if you want an early harvest of tender, sweet stalks.</p>
            <p>Forcing involves covering the crowns with a light-excluding container, such as an upturned bucket or a purpose-made rhubarb forcer, to encourage rapid growth in the dark. This process stimulates the plant to produce pale, delicate stalks by drawing on its stored energy reserves. Ensure the crown is well-mulched and protected from frost before covering, and in a few weeks, you’ll enjoy flavorful stems ready for picking, bringing a taste of spring to your kitchen while the garden is still in winter’s grip.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-box hellebores">
            <h1>Cut off hellebore leaves at the base</h1>
            <p>January is an ideal time to cut off the old leaves of hellebores at their base. Removing these leaves helps to reduce the spread of black spot and other fungal diseases that can overwinter on the foliage. It also allows the emerging flowers to take center stage, ensuring they are not obscured by tired or damaged foliage.</p>
            <p>Use clean, sharp scissors or pruners to make neat cuts close to the crown of the plant, taking care not to damage the emerging flower stems. This simple task will not only protect the plant’s health but also showcase the beautiful winter blooms in your garden.</p>

            <h1>TIP: Clean pots and greenhouses ready for spring</h1>
            <p>Cleaning greenhouses, whether glass or plastic, greatly improves the growing environment for plants. By removing the algae, moss and grime it lets in more light and helps control pests and diseases too.</p>
