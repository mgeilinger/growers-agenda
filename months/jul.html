        <p>Welcome to Growers Agenda! This platform was set up as a tool to help keep track of the monthly tasks, specific to what you've got growing in your garden.</p>
        <p>On the right, under the 'my garden' tab, you are able to input all the plants growing in your garden, creating a personalised profile for yourself. From there, you'll receive monthly reminders for pruning, fertilizing, and other essential maintenance tasks tailored to each plant's specific needs.</p>
        <p>Once all your flowers are updated, you may also use the 'flowering time' feature. This tool allows you to see what you can expect to see flowering in your garden at any given month of the year.</p>

            <h1>Gardening in July</h1>
            <p>With summer in full swing, July calls for diligent watering and weeding. Harvest vegetables like beans and courgettes, and keep an eye out for pests on vulnerable plants.</p>

        <div class="text-box wisteria">
            <h1>Prune wisteria</h1>
            <p>July is the perfect time to summer prune wisteria, as the plant is in full growth and can be shaped to maintain its structure and encourage better flowering. Pruning in summer helps to control excessive growth and redirects the plant's energy into developing flower buds for the following year.</p>
            <p>Use sharp secateurs to trim back the long, whippy shoots from the current yearâ€™s growth. Cut them back to around five or six leaves from the main stem, leaving enough foliage to feed the plant while keeping it tidy.</p>
            <p>Summer pruning is also an excellent time to ensure the plant stays within its desired space. Remove any shoots growing out of bounds or encroaching on nearby plants. For wisteria trained against walls or pergolas, tie in selected shoots to strengthen the framework.</p>
