        <p>Welcome to Growers Agenda! This platform was set up as a tool to help keep track of the monthly tasks, specific to what you've got growing in your garden.</p>
        <p>On the right, under the 'my garden' tab, you are able to input all the plants growing in your garden, creating a personalized profile for yourself. From there, you'll receive monthly reminders for pruning, fertilizing, and other essential maintenance tasks tailored to each plant's specific needs.</p>
        <p>Once all your flowers are updated, you may also use the 'flowering time' feature. This tool allows you to see what you can expect to see flowering in your garden at any given month of the year.</p>

            <h1>Gardening in December</h1>
            <p>A month of rest for gardeners, December is for enjoying winter beauty. Prune dormant trees and shrubs, care for indoor plants, and plan ahead for a productive new year.</p>

            <h1>Prune wisteria</h1>
            <p>Now is the best time to winter prune wisteria, as the plant is dormant and leafless. Pruning in winter encourages the development of short spurs that carry the flowers in spring. It also ensures that the flowers won't be hidden by leaves.</p>
            <p>Use sharp secateurs to count the buds from the main stem and snip off the growth just after the third bud. You can also remove any dead, diseased, or crossing branches.</p>
            <p>You can also use winter pruning to reshape the structure of your wisteria plant. If the plant has a lot of dry, old branches, you can cut it back hard. This will give your wisteria an impulse to shoot new strong branches.</p>
