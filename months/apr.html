        <p>Welcome to Growers Agenda! This platform was set up as a tool to help keep track of the monthly tasks, specific to what you've got growing in your garden.</p>
        <p>On the right, under the 'my garden' tab, you are able to input all the plants growing in your garden, creating a personalised profile for yourself. From there, you'll receive monthly reminders for pruning, fertilizing, and other essential maintenance tasks tailored to each plant's specific needs.</p>
        <p>Once all your flowers are updated, you may also use the 'flowering time' feature. This tool allows you to see what you can expect to see flowering in your garden at any given month of the year.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="top-bar" id="topBar">
        <div id="timeline-info">
            <h1>Flowering Time</h1>
            <p>The timeline provides a clear visual representation of the months in which your plants will be flowering. This tool was designed to help you identify periods where nothing is in bloom, allowing you to consider introducing new plants to fill these gaps and ensure a continuous display of flowers throughout the year.</p>

            <h1>Gardening in April</h1>
            <p>The garden bursts into life in April, making it one of the busiest months. Plant potatoes, sow vegetables like carrots and beetroot, and keep an eye out for late frosts to protect tender shoots.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-box figTree">
            <h1>Prune fig tree</h1>
            <p>Prune fig trees in April before new growth begins. Start by removing any dead, damaged, or crossing branches to maintain a strong framework and improve air circulation.</p>
            <p>Cut back last yearâ€™s growth to encourage fruiting spurs, focusing on shaping the tree to keep it compact and manageable. If your tree is overgrown, remove no more than a third of the older wood to avoid stress. Regular pruning ensures a healthier tree and better fruit production.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-box bamboo">
            <h1>Divide bamboos</h1>
            <p>April is an ideal month to divide bamboos as they begin their active growth phase. Select a healthy clump and dig around its perimeter to lift it from the ground. Use a sharp spade or saw to divide the root ball into smaller sections, ensuring each piece has strong roots and healthy shoots.</p>
            <p>Replant the divisions immediately in prepared soil or containers, keeping them well-watered to help establish their roots. Dividing bamboos in spring invigorates the plants and prevents overcrowding, encouraging vigorous growth throughout the season.</p>

        <div class="text-box idea">
            <h1>IDEA: Sow hardy annuals, herbs and wild flower seed outdoors</h1>
            <p>April is the perfect month to sow hardy annuals like cornflowers, herbs such as parsley, and wildflower seeds like poppies directly outdoors. The soil is warming up, creating ideal conditions for germination. Choose a sunny, well-drained spot and prepare the soil by removing weeds and raking it to a fine tilth.</p>
            <p>Sow seeds thinly in drills or scatter them in designated areas for a natural look. Lightly cover with soil and water gently. Keep the soil moist during germination, and within weeks, you'll see young seedlings emerge, setting the stage for a vibrant display later in the year.</p>

            <h1>TIP: Keep weeds under control</h1>
            <p>Remove weeds that will smother seedlings and small plants, by hoeing or digging out.</p>
