        <p>Welcome to Growers Agenda! This platform was set up as a tool to help keep track of the monthly tasks, specific to what you've got growing in your garden.</p>
        <p>On the right, under the 'my garden' tab, you are able to input all the plants growing in your garden, creating a personalised profile for yourself. From there, you'll receive monthly reminders for pruning, fertilizing, and other essential maintenance tasks tailored to each plant's specific needs.</p>
        <p>Once all your flowers are updated, you may also use the 'flowering time' feature. This tool allows you to see what you can expect to see flowering in your garden at any given month of the year.</p>

            <p style="margin-left: 282px">Allowing you to consider introducing new plants to fill these gaps and ensure a continuous display of flowers throughout the year.</p>

            <h1>Gardening in February</h1>
            <p>With the first signs of spring on the horizon, February is a great time to sow early seeds under cover. Cut back winter shrubs, check for emerging bulbs, and start preparing soil for planting.</p>

        <div class="text-box silvergrass">
            <h1>Cut back silvergrass</h1>
            <p>February is the ideal time to cut back silvergrass before the new growth begins. This helps remove any dead growth, improves air circulation, and encourages fresh, vibrant shoots to emerge in spring.</p>
            <p>Use sharp secateurs or pruning shears to trim back the old, brown foliage to about 4-6 inches above the ground. Be careful not to cut into the crown of the plant, as it can harm its growth.</p>

            <h1>IDEA: Begin sowing early crops indoors</h1>
            <p>February is a great time to start sowing early crops like tomatoes and peppers indoors, giving them a head start before the warmer weather arrives.</p>
            <p>Start by filling seed trays with compost and sowing seeds according to the packet instructions, ensuring they are kept warm and in a well-lit spot. Be sure to harden them off gradually by exposing them to outdoor conditions before transplanting into the garden.</p>
