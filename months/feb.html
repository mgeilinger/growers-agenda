        <p>Welcome to Growers Agenda! This platform was set up as a tool to help keep track of the monthly tasks, specific to what you've got growing in your garden.</p>
        <p>On the right, under the 'my garden' tab, you are able to input all the plants growing in your garden, creating a personalized profile for yourself. From there, you'll receive monthly reminders for pruning, fertilizing, and other essential maintenance tasks tailored to each plant's specific needs.</p>
        <p>Once all your flowers are updated, you may also use the 'flowering time' feature. This tool allows you to see what you can expect to see flowering in your garden at any given month of the year.</p>

            <h1>Gardening in February</h1>
            <p>With the first signs of spring on the horizon, February is a great time to sow early seeds under cover. Cut back winter shrubs, check for emerging bulbs, and start preparing soil for planting.</p>

        <div class="text-box butterflyBush">
            <h1>Prune butterfly bush</h1>
            <p>Pruning your butterfly bush is essential for maintaining its health and promoting vigorous growth and abundant flowering. Begin by removing any dead, damaged, or diseased branches, cutting them back to healthy tissue. Next, prune back the remaining stems to about 12-18 inches above ground level in late winter or early spring before new growth emerges. This encourages the development of strong new shoots and prevents the plant from becoming leggy. Additionally, deadheading spent flowers throughout the growing season will prolong blooming and keep the bush looking tidy. With regular pruning, your butterfly bush will thrive, attracting pollinators and adding beauty to your garden landscape.</p>

        <div class="text-box wisteria">
            <h1>Prune wisteria</h1>
            <p>Pruning wisteria in March is a crucial step to maintain its health and promote optimal flowering. Begin by assessing the plant's structure, removing any dead or damaged branches to encourage new growth. Trim back lateral shoots to two or three buds from the main framework, ensuring a tidy appearance and encouraging flowering. Pay attention to any unruly growth or tendrils that may be encroaching on nearby structures, pruning them back to maintain the desired shape and prevent overcrowding. Additionally, use this time to untangle any intertwined branches and train them along supports if necessary. Pruning in February allows for the wisteria's energy to be redirected towards producing vibrant blooms in the coming spring and summer months.</p>
