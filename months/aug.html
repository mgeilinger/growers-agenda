        <p>Welcome to Growers Agenda! This platform was set up as a tool to help keep track of the monthly tasks, specific to what you've got growing in your garden.</p>
        <p>On the right, under the 'my garden' tab, you are able to input all the plants growing in your garden, creating a personalised profile for yourself. From there, you'll receive monthly reminders for pruning, fertilizing, and other essential maintenance tasks tailored to each plant's specific needs.</p>
        <p>Once all your flowers are updated, you may also use the 'flowering time' feature. This tool allows you to see what you can expect to see flowering in your garden at any given month of the year.</p>

            <p style="margin-left: 290px">This tool was designed to help you identify periods where nothing is in bloom.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 272px">Allowing you to consider introducing new plants to fill these gaps and ensure a continuous display of flowers throughout the year.</p>

            <h1>Gardening in August</h1>
            <p>A time of harvest and plenty, August is perfect for gathering fruits, herbs, and vegetables. Prune summer-flowering shrubs and prepare for autumn planting as the season begins to shift.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-box lavender">
            <h1>Prune lavender</h1>
            <p>August is the ideal time to prune lavender, as flowering has typically finished and the plant begins preparing for dormancy. Pruning now helps maintain its shape, encourages healthy new growth, and prevents the plant from becoming woody and sprawling.</p>
            <p>Using sharp, clean shears, trim back the spent flower stalks and reduce the green growth by about one-third. Avoid cutting into the woody stems, as these do not regrow. For older plants, focus on shaping the plant lightly while preserving its structure. A well-pruned lavender in August will reward you with a compact, neat appearance and vibrant blooms next summer.</p>

        <div class="text-box climbingHydrangea">
            <h1>Prune climbing hydrangeas</h1>
            <p>In August, after climbing hydrangeas have finished flowering, it's an ideal time to prune the plant to maintain its shape and encourage healthy growth. Start by removing any dead or damaged wood, cutting back any spent flowers, and thinning out any overcrowded areas. This will help improve air circulation and light penetration within the plant. You can also trim back any long or unruly stems that have outgrown their space, cutting them back to a healthy bud or main branch.</p>
            <p>Be cautious not to cut back too much of the plant, as climbing hydrangeas flower on old wood, and heavy pruning could reduce next yearâ€™s blooms.</p>
