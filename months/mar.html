        <p>Welcome to Growers Agenda! This platform was set up as a tool to help keep track of the monthly tasks, specific to what you've got growing in your garden.</p>
        <p>On the right, under the 'my garden' tab, you are able to input all the plants growing in your garden, creating a personalised profile for yourself. From there, you'll receive monthly reminders for pruning, fertilizing, and other essential maintenance tasks tailored to each plant's specific needs.</p>
        <p>Once all your flowers are updated, you may also use the 'flowering time' feature. This tool allows you to see what you can expect to see flowering in your garden at any given month of the year.</p>

            <h1>Gardening in March</h1>
            <p>Spring usually starts to arrive across the country in March, and the longer days provide the opportunity for an increasing range of gardening tasks. It’s time to get busy preparing seed beds and sowing seed, and it’s your last chance to prune roses.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-box butterflyBush">
            <h1>Prune butterfly bush</h1>
            <p>March is the ideal time to hard prune your butterfly bush before the growing season. Hard pruning encourages vigorous new growth and ensures the plant maintains a compact, manageable shape. It also promotes the development of more abundant and vibrant flowers, which attract pollinators later in the year.</p>
            <p>To prune, use sharp, clean secateurs or loppers to cut all stems back to within 12-18 inches (30-45 cm) of the ground. Focus on removing any dead, damaged, or crossing branches to create an open framework that allows light and air to circulate. For older, woody plants, you can also cut a few of the oldest stems right down to the base to encourage fresh growth from the roots.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-box agapanthus">
            <h1>Divide agapanthus</h1>
            <p>March is an excellent time to divide agapanthus, as the plant is just emerging from dormancy. Dividing helps rejuvenate overcrowded clumps and promotes healthier growth and more prolific flowering.</p>
            <p>Lift the plant carefully with a garden fork, shaking off excess soil to expose the roots. Use a sharp spade or knife to divide the clump into smaller sections, ensuring each division has healthy roots and at least one growing shoot. Replant immediately in well-draining soil, water thoroughly, and apply a balanced fertiliser to support establishment.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-box wisteria">
            <h1>Fertilise wisteria</h1>
            <p>Feed your wisteria in March with Growmore or Fish, Blood and Bone at the recommended rate shown on the packet. In sandy soils (which have low potassium levels) also apply sulphate of potash at 20g per sq m (1/2 oz per sq yd). You can also use rose or flowering shrub fertilisers.</p>
            <p>In containers, feed wisteria with liquid tomato fertiliser, Phostrogen, Miracle-Gro or a similar flowering plant food. Alternatively you can mix controlled-release fertiliser into the compost.</p>
        </div>
        <!-- IDEA text box: -->
        <div class="text-box idea">
            <h1>IDEA: Plant summer flowering bulbs</h1>
            <p>March is the perfect time to plant summer-flowering bulbs, such as dahlias, lilies, and gladioli. As the soil begins to warm, choose a sunny, well-drained spot and prepare it by loosening the earth and adding compost or grit if needed.</p>
            <p>Plant bulbs at the recommended depth, usually two to three times their height, with the pointed end facing upward. Water thoroughly after planting to help establish roots, and consider adding a layer of mulch to retain moisture and suppress weeds. These bulbs will reward you with vibrant summer blooms.</p>

            <h1>TIP: Keep some dandelions around</h1>
            <p>The cheery yellow flowers and ‘clock’ seedheads of dandelions are a familiar sight throughout the UK. Although not always welcome in formal, manicured lawns, dandelions are a great way to attract wildlife and increase biodiversity in your garden. </p>
