        <p>Welcome to Growers Agenda! This platform was set up as a tool to help keep track of the monthly tasks, specific to what you've got growing in your garden.</p>
        <p>On the right, under the 'my garden' tab, you are able to input all the plants growing in your garden, creating a personalised profile for yourself. From there, you'll receive monthly reminders for pruning, fertilizing, and other essential maintenance tasks tailored to each plant's specific needs.</p>
        <p>Once all your flowers are updated, you may also use the 'flowering time' feature. This tool allows you to see what you can expect to see flowering in your garden at any given month of the year.</p>

            <h1>Gardening in November</h1>
            <p>November is the time to prepare the garden for winter. Plant bare-root roses, tidy borders, and insulate pots and containers to protect against frost.</p>

        <div class="text-box idea">
            <h1>IDEA: Plant roses</h1>
            <p>November is an ideal time to plant roses in your garden, as the cooler temperatures allow the roots to establish before the spring growing season. Bare-root roses, in particular, thrive when planted during this month, as they benefit from the winter's moisture and the opportunity to settle into the soil.</p>
            <p>Choose a sunny spot with well-drained soil, and ensure the planting hole is wide enough to accommodate the roots. Mulching around the base of the plant can help protect the roots and retain moisture during the colder months.</p>
            <p>Avoid planting in areas where roses were previously growing otherwise new introductions may suffer from replant diseases (rose sickness).</p>

        <div class="text-box tip">
            <h1>TIP: Put out food for winter birds</h1>
            <p>As temperatures drop, birds rely on feeders for a reliable food source, so offering seeds, suet, and nuts can attract a variety of species. Providing a mix of food helps support different birds with varied diets, ensuring they stay nourished through the colder months.</p>
            <p>Consider placing your feeders in sheltered spots to offer protection from harsh weather and predators.</p>
