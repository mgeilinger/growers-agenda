    <div class="about-box" id="aboutBox">
        <p>Welcome to Growers Agenda! This platform was set up as a tool to help keep track of the monthly tasks, specific to what you've got growing in your garden.</p>
        <p>On the right, under the 'my garden' tab, you are able to input all the plants growing in your garden, creating a personalised profile for yourself. From there, you'll receive monthly reminders for pruning, fertilizing, and other essential maintenance tasks tailored to each plant's specific needs.</p>
        <p>Once all your flowers are updated, you may also use the 'flowering time' feature. This tool allows you to see what you can expect to see flowering in your garden at any given month of the year.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="top-bar" id="topBar">
        <div id="timeline-info">
            <h1>Flowering Time</h1>
            <p>The timeline provides a clear visual representation of the months in which your plants will be flowering. This tool was designed to help you identify periods where nothing is in bloom, allowing you to consider introducing new plants to fill these gaps and ensure a continuous display of flowers throughout the year.</p>

            <h1>Gardening in June</h1>
            <p>June is a month of abundance, with flowers blooming and early crops ready to harvest. Deadhead roses and annuals, stake tall plants, and enjoy the vibrant colors of summer.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-box rosemary">
            <h1>Prune rosemary</h1>
            <p>June is the perfect time to prune rosemary after its spring flowering period. By this point, the flowers have faded, and the plant can benefit from light pruning to maintain its shape and encourage healthy new growth.</p>
            <p>Use sharp, clean secateurs to trim back the flowering stems by about one-third, ensuring you don’t cut into the woody, older growth, as rosemary struggles to regenerate from hard wood. Focus on shaping the plant into a neat, bushy form. Removing spent flowers and unruly shoots will keep the plant tidy and prevent it from becoming leggy.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-box forsythia">
            <h1>Prune forsythia</h1>
            <p>Prune forsythia in June after its bright yellow spring blooms have faded. Trimming immediately after flowering ensures the plant has enough time to produce new growth for next year’s display.</p>
            <p>Focus on removing old or overgrown stems, cutting back to healthy buds, and thinning out the center to improve air circulation and shape. This keeps the shrub healthy, tidy, and bursting with flowers next spring.</p>
        </div>
        <!-- TIP text box: -->
        <div class="text-box tip">
            <h1>TIP: Hoe borders regularly to keep down weeds</h1>
            <p>Regular hoeing in June is essential to keep borders weed-free, as warm weather encourages rapid weed growth. A quick, light hoeing disrupts young weeds and prevents them from competing with your plants for nutrients and water.</p>
