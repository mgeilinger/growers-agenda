        <p>Welcome to Growers Agenda! This platform was set up as a tool to help keep track of the monthly tasks, specific to what you've got growing in your garden.</p>
        <p>On the right, under the 'my garden' tab, you are able to input all the plants growing in your garden, creating a personalized profile for yourself. From there, you'll receive monthly reminders for pruning, fertilizing, and other essential maintenance tasks tailored to each plant's specific needs.</p>
        <p>Once all your flowers are updated, you may also use the 'flowering time' feature. This tool allows you to see what you can expect to see flowering in your garden at any given month of the year.</p>

            <h1>Gardening in March</h1>
            <p>Spring usually starts to arrive across the country in March, and the longer days provide the opportunity for an increasing range of gardening tasks. It’s time to get busy preparing seed beds and sowing seed, and it’s your last chance to prune roses.</p>

            <h1>Prune wisteria</h1>
            <p>Pruning wisteria in February is a crucial step to maintain its health and promote optimal flowering. Begin by assessing the plant's structure, removing any dead or damaged branches to encourage new growth. Trim back lateral shoots to two or three buds from the main framework, ensuring a tidy appearance and encouraging flowering. Pay attention to any unruly growth or tendrils that may be encroaching on nearby structures, pruning them back to maintain the desired shape and prevent overcrowding. Additionally, use this time to untangle any intertwined branches and train them along supports if necessary. Pruning in February allows for the wisteria's energy to be redirected towards producing vibrant blooms in the coming spring and summer months.</p>
